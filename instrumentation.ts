/**
 * Phase 35 — Next.js server-boot hook. Closes [23.D5].
 *
 * `register()` is called exactly once when the Next.js Node server
 * starts (both `next dev` and `next start`). This is the canonical
 * place to start long-running background tasks. The Edge runtime
 * doesn't run our DB code, so we gate on `NEXT_RUNTIME === "nodejs"`.
 *
 * The dispatch watchdog runs every 5 minutes in-process. Without this,
 * hung Dispatch rows past their `expectedBy` deadline hold queue slots
 * until the dev server restarts.
 *
 * Phase 41.5 — also drains the webhook spool at boot + on an interval,
 * replaying Stop-hook pings that were spooled while the server (or `op`)
 * was down. Boot is exactly when the server is back UP, so draining
 * there recovers the pings that would otherwise vanish.
 *
 * Fix 41.D9 — self-heal the canonical Stop-hook script at boot: copy
 * scripts/session-complete-hook.sh to the $HOME-stable location the
 * committed hooks reference (~/.cascade/session-complete-hook.sh). A
 * freshly-cloned machine gets a working hook even before install-hooks
 * is re-run. Wrapped so a copy failure never crashes server startup.
